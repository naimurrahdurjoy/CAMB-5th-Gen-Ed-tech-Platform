  name: "Beaker", 
  description: "For holding liquids",
  icon: "ü•É",
  category: "glassware"
}
```

### **Drag-and-Drop Workflow:**
1. **Student drags equipment** ‚Üí Triggers `handleEquipmentDrag()`
2. **Drops on workspace zone** ‚Üí Calls `handleEquipmentDrop()`
3. **AI processes action** ‚Üí `geminiGameAPI.processGameAction()`
4. **Updates game state** ‚Üí Visual feedback + score update
5. **Auto-saves progress** ‚Üí Preserves state for resume

### **Chemical Mixing System:**
```javascript
// Interactive chemical reactions
const mixingResult = await geminiGameAPI.processChemicalMixing({
  chemical1: "HCl",
  chemical2: "NaOH", 
  currentGameState,
  experimentContext
});
// Results in realistic color changes, bubbles, etc.
```

```javascript
await geminiGameAPI.generateGameInstructions({
  experimentTitle: "Acid-Base Titration",
  experimentType: "chemistry",
  level: 3,
  description: "Virtual titration experiment"
});
```

### **2. Action Processing**
```javascript
await geminiGameAPI.processGameAction({
  action: 'use_equipment',
  equipment: selectedBeaker,
  target: 'beaker_zone',
  currentGameState,
  experimentContext
});
```

### **3. Contextual Hints**
```javascript
await geminiGameAPI.generateHint({
  currentGameState,
  experimentContext
});
```
