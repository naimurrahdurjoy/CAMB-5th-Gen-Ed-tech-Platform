## ðŸ”’ Security & Validation

### File Upload Security:
- File type validation (whitelist approach)
- File size limits (configurable per assignment)
- Virus scanning
- Secure file storage with unique names
- Access control (students can only access their own files)

### API Security:
- JWT token validation
- Role-based access control
- Rate limiting on file uploads
- Input sanitization
- SQL injection prevention

### Data Validation:
- Assignment due date must be in future
- File types must match allowed types
- File size must not exceed limits
- Grade scores must be within valid range
- Required fields validation

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Considerations

### File Storage:
- Use cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
- CDN for file delivery
- Thumbnail generation for images
- File compression for large uploads

### Database Optimization:
- Indexes on frequently queried fields
- Pagination for large result sets
- Aggregation pipelines for statistics
- Efficient queries for submission counts

### Caching:
- Cache assignment lists
- Cache submission statistics
- Cache grade calculations
- Redis for session management

## ðŸš¨ Error Handling

### Common Error Codes:
- `400` - Bad Request (invalid data, file too large)
- `401` - Unauthorized (invalid token)
- `403` - Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- `404` - Not Found (assignment/submission not found)
- `409` - Conflict (assignment already submitted)
- `413` - Payload Too Large (file size exceeded)
- `415` - Unsupported Media Type (invalid file type)
- `429` - Too Many Requests (rate limit exceeded)
- `500` - Internal Server Error

### Error Response Format:
```javascript
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "FILE_TOO_LARGE",
    "message": "File size exceeds the maximum allowed limit of 10MB",
    "details": {
      "maxSize": 10485760,
      "receivedSize": 15728640
    }
  }
}
```

## ðŸ“± Frontend Integration Requirements

### Required Frontend Features:
1. **Assignment Creation Form** (Teachers)
2. **Assignment List View** (Teachers & Students)  
3. **File Upload Component** with progress
4. **Grading Interface** with rubric
5. **Submission History View** (Students)
6. **Notification Display** (Parents)
7. **Assignment Dashboard** (All roles)

### State Management:
- Assignment list state
- Submission status tracking
- File upload progress
- Grade notifications
- Real-time updates

This comprehensive API specification ensures robust assignment management with proper security, versioning, and notification systems.
